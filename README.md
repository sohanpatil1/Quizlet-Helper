# Quizlet-Helper using Selenium Automation
Since I need to regularly open Quizlet, login and open specific textbooks to read, I have built a Selenium tool that helps me do this easily.

The tool scans the clipboard frequently such that a new link is opened everytime the scripts sees a Quizlet URL in the clipboard.

Steps I follow to use the tool
- Run main.py
- Copy question URL on clipboard
- Read contents from webapge
- Copy another question URL on clipboard
